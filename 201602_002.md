A couple of days after the first logged event, Fernando, Miguel and Pedro are in a Ruby meetup. This time there were live demos.

## 1

Miguel's talk was going pretty well. Then he said "Ok, let's do a live demo". I'm taking over the log.

## 2

Apparently the live demo is only Miguel ~~bragging about~~ showing the product website they built.

## 3

30s into the live demo, Pedro's VPN just blocked the access to the showcased product.

## 4

Miguel refuses to do the captcha. He's now trying to use the staging server. Turns out he still needs a captcha.

## 5

Miguel just tried to convince people to use the product so he doesn't have to do the captcha. It was a nice attempt, Miguel, but we want to watch the ship sink.

## 6

Miguel just accepted his fate. Miguel is going to write the captcha.

## 7

Turns out the captcha involves recognizing water and grass in random pictures, instead of typing.
Aaaaaand he failed miserabily.

## 8

Pedro is having none of that and decides to join the fun. Pedro is doing the captcha!

## 9

Aaaand Pedro failed.

## 10

Miguel wanted to choose Gold as currency. Miguel just gifted someone Silver.

## 11

Miguel just found a bug. It's Pedro's fault. Now it's Miguel's fault. Now it's Pedro's fault. Now it's the designer's fault.

## 12

Oh, boy! It's Pedro's turn up at bat.

## 13

Pedro does not want to offend the public but offends the public by saying he wanted a more experienced public.

## 14

Pedro blames the computer for spontaneously advancing his slides.

Pedro doesn't know how to computer.

## 15

Pedro keeps thinking his laptop has voice recognition and blames him for his failure to show static images on a projector.

## 16

Pedro states his presentation would be better done in CSS.

Pedro clearly doesn't know anything about CSS.

## 17

Pedro talks about tests and having correctness in his code. In the meantime, the background image shows a man praying. Irony much?

## 18

Pedro uses latin quotes. Pedro quickly skips the latin quote after realizing his mistake.

## 19

Pedro follows the Hollywood trend of 2015 and forcibly introduces mutants in his work. It's already 2016 though.

## 20

Pedro takes another minute to talk to his computer again.

## 21

Pedro probably went back to his 9th grade Power Point years and is using awful text intro animations in his presentation. I'm predicting WordArt in the next slide.

## 22

Pedro changes focus to his terminal and starts typing. Pedro is doomed.

## 23

Pedro is now live coding.

## 24

Pedro thinks by showing "the simplest possible example" he's immune to the curses of live demos. Oh, silly Pedro.

## 25

Oh God, it's the calculator from the last log. You can't make this up.

## 26

First run, all tests passed. Clearly the tests are wrong.

## 27

Pedro says he's going to introduce errors in his code "on purpose". Yeah right.

## 28

Pedro does not run his integration tests while developing. Miguel will shame Pedro about this in the near future

## 29

Now the color scheme is to blame for the presentation's problems.

## 30

I'll take a minute here to notice that Pedro is giving a talk about mistakes, which he only does as a cover for the mistakes he makes on stage.

## 31

Pedro is about to finish. However, there was still time for another mistake on Keynote.

## 32

Pedro missed his semi-colons on his bullet list. Proen√ßa is now having a seizure in his sleep.

## 33

Pedro uses Bioshock to earn applause from the crowd. He succeeded.

## 34

Pedro was going rather well. At the very end, he mentions JavaScript.
