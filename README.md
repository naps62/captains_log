It took less than 5 minutes for Pedro to mention meta programming


# 2
Os valores booleanos só podem ser "true" ou "falso"

# 3
Five minutes in, Pedro thinks he's using JavaScript, and types Math.round(2.5)

# 4
Pedro tries to explain symbols. Pedro ends up talking about enums and state machines.

# 5
Pedro brings shame upon the Ruby philosophy by stating "`if` conditions must return a boolean"

# 6
Pedro is now showing C code examples

# 7
After making an effort to show a for-loop in C, Pedro erases the whole thing and says "In Ruby, you don't use this"

# 8
After going to C-land, symbols, blocks and arguments, Pedro is afraid to talk about not needing parenthesis

# 9
Question from the audience: "As funções devolvem um simbolo com o nome delas?"
Answer: Something about `Object#methods` and meta programming

# 10
Pedro doesn't know if class names require CamelCase.
Pedro doesn't know how to Ruby.

# 11
Pedro doesn't know he can't call module methods directly
Pedro doesn't know how to Ruby.

# 12
Pedro still wants to talk about module methods, despite not wanting to include them.
So he's now using self, which leads to him trying to explain what `self` his.

# 13
Pedro fails to explain what `self` is.

# 14
Miguel notices Pedro has `def method do` in the blackboard
Miguel realizes Pedro doesn't know how to Ruby

# 15
Pedro decides a coffee break is better before diving into Objects.
Pedro finally makes a good decision.
Coincidentally, it's the first non-programming thing he talks about

# 16
Fernando uses `number_of_paws` as an example for methods of cat instances.
3-legged cats are inevitably about to show up.

# 17
Fernando is now diving into class instance variables. Oh god why

# 18
Fernando is using class variables instead of class instance variables. Oh god why

# 19
Fernando goes back to his Java knowledge and suggests `get_name`

# 20
Only 10 minutes til lunch time. "Let's code a calculator really quick, with square roots and all".

# 21
First minute in, Miguel sighs in despair.

# 22
Second minute in, Miguel asks a question he immediately regrets.

# 23
Miguel is now trying to sell Rails as a way to do HTML. Sounds promising.

# 24
First time Miguel tries a rails command, it fails. Mayhem begins.

# 26
Nokogiri installed on the first attempt, coffee-rails fails, nobody knows why. You win some, you lose some.
